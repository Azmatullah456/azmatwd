            <p>
                A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees if there are trees around.
                A male chicken is called a rooster or a cockerel . A female chicken is called a hen. A young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks.
                When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat, and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this.

            <p>
               A meat dish is a prepared item of food that consists either wholly or partly of meat. Meat dishes are considered distinct from dishes which are seafood, fish, insect or other animal based. Dairy and egg dishes, though based on animal products, are also considered separate from meat dishes.

            <h3 class="text-center">Sushi   </h3>
            <p>
              Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
